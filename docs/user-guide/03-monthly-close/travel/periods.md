Group business trip expenses together for organized tracking and reporting.

## Overview

A [Travel Period](../../04-reference/glossary.md#travel-period) is a defined time window representing a business trip. All expenses within that period are automatically linked, making it easy to track total trip costs and generate travel reports.

## Why Use Travel Periods

| **Organization** | Group all trip expenses together |
| **Visibility** | See total trip cost at a glance |
| **Reporting** | Generate per-trip expense reports |
| **Compliance** | Track against travel policies |
| **Budgeting** | Compare actual vs. planned costs |

## Auto-Linking Expenses

### How It Works

Once a travel period is created:

1. System scans expenses in the date range
2. Travel-related expenses are auto-linked:
   - Flights and airlines
   - Hotels and lodging
   - Ground transportation
   - Meals (within per diem)
   - Conference fees

### Auto-Link Categories

These categories link automatically:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Transportation** | Flights, trains, Uber/Lyft |
| **Lodging** | Hotels, Airbnb |
| **Meals** | Restaurants during trip |
| **Ground Transport** | Rental cars, parking, taxis |
| **Conference** | Registration, materials |

### Expenses That Don't Auto-Link

Some need manual review:

- Expenses just before/after trip dates
- Non-obvious categories (Office Supplies purchased while traveling)
- Personal expenses mixed with business

## Best Practices

### Create Early

- Set up travel period before the trip
- Expenses link as they occur
- Easier to track in real-time

### Accurate Dates

- Include travel days (departure and return)
- Account for layovers or extended stays
- Adjust if plans change

### Meaningful Names

| Less Helpful | More Helpful |
|--------------|--------------|
| "Trip 1" | "Austin TX - SXSW 2025" |
| "March travel" | "Chicago - Quarterly Sales Meeting" |
| "Client" | "Acme Corp Site Visit - Dallas" |

### Regular Review

During the trip:

- Check linked expenses daily
- Add receipts promptly
- Note any missing expenses

## Troubleshooting

### "Expense Not Auto-Linked"

If an expected expense didn't link:

1. Verify expense date falls within period
2. Check expense category matches travel types
3. Manually link if needed

### "Wrong Expenses Linked"

If unrelated expenses were linked:

1. Review the expenses
2. Unlink incorrect ones
3. Adjust period dates if too broad

### "Can't Delete Travel Period"

If deletion is blocked:

1. Check if included in a report
2. Unlink all expenses first
3. Then delete the period
