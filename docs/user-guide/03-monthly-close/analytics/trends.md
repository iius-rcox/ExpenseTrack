# Trends Analysis

Compare spending across time periods and identify patterns.

## Overview

Trends analysis helps you understand how your spending changes over time. Compare month-over-month, spot seasonal patterns, and identify unusual spending spikes.

## Accessing Trends

2. Click the **Trends** tab or section

## Trend Chart

### Reading the Chart

The trend chart shows:

- **Primary line**: Current period spending
- **Secondary line**: Comparison period (if enabled)
- **Shaded area**: Difference between periods
- **Data points**: Individual time units (days/weeks/months)

### Chart Granularity

Choose how data is grouped:

| Granularity | Best For |
|-------------|----------|
| **Daily** | Short periods (1-2 weeks) |
| **Weekly** | Monthly analysis |
| **Monthly** | Quarterly/annual analysis |

Select granularity from the dropdown above the chart.

## Period Comparison

### Enabling Comparison

1. Check **Compare to previous period**
2. Or select specific comparison:
   - **Previous period** (same length, earlier dates)
   - **Same period last year**
   - **Custom period**

### Comparison Indicators

When comparison is enabled:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| ▲ Green | Spending decreased (positive) |
| ▼ Red | Spending increased (caution) |
| — Gray | Spending unchanged |

Percentage change shows next to each metric.

### Example Comparison

**This Month vs. Last Month**:

- Meals: $320 → $280 (▲ 12% decrease)

## Spotting Patterns

### Weekly Patterns

Look for consistent day-of-week spending:

- **Monday/Friday**: Often higher (travel days)
- **Weekends**: May show different patterns
- **Mid-week**: Often lower for business travel

### Monthly Patterns

Common patterns to watch:

| Pattern | Likely Cause |
|---------|--------------|
| End-of-month spike | Deadline purchases |
| First-week spike | Beginning-of-cycle subscriptions |
| Mid-month dip | Post-payroll slowdown |
| Quarterly bump | Recurring quarterly expenses |

### Seasonal Trends

Year-over-year comparison reveals:

- Holiday period spending
- Seasonal business travel
