# Sorting Transactions

Organize your transaction list by different criteria.

## Overview

Sort transactions to find what you need quickly or to process items in a logical order. Click any column header to sort by that column.

## Sort Options

### Sort by Date

**Default sort**: Most recent first

Click the **Date** column header:
- First click: Newest first (descending)
- Second click: Oldest first (ascending)

**Use when**: Reviewing chronological activity, finding recent transactions

### Sort by Amount

Click the **Amount** column header:
- First click: Highest first (descending)
- Second click: Lowest first (ascending)

**Use when**: Finding large expenses, reviewing spending by size

### Sort by Merchant/Vendor

Click the **Merchant** or **Description** column header:
- First click: A to Z (ascending)
- Second click: Z to A (descending)

**Use when**: Grouping transactions by vendor, finding specific merchants

### Sort by Category

Click the **Category** column header:
- First click: A to Z (ascending)
- Second click: Z to A (descending)

**Use when**: Reviewing by expense type, checking categorization

### Sort by Status

Click the **Status** column header:
- Sorts by match status: Unmatched → Pending → Matched

**Use when**: Focusing on unmatched items, reviewing pending matches

## Sort Indicators

Visual indicators show current sort:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **↑** (Up arrow) | Ascending (A-Z, oldest, lowest) |
| **↓** (Down arrow) | Descending (Z-A, newest, highest) |
| No arrow | Not sorted by this column |

## Sort with Filters

Sorting works with active filters:

1. Apply [filters](./filtering.md) to narrow results
2. Click column header to sort filtered results
3. Only filtered transactions are reordered
4. Sort persists when changing filters

**Example workflow**:
1. Filter to "This Month"
2. Sort by Amount (highest first)
3. See your largest expenses this month

## Multi-Column Sort

Currently, ExpenseFlow sorts by one column at a time. For complex sorting:

1. Sort by primary column (e.g., Date)
2. Items with same date maintain secondary order
3. Use filters to narrow then sort

## Sort Persistence

Your sort preference:
- Persists during your session
- Resets to default (Date, newest) on page refresh
- Not saved across sessions

## Keyboard Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **Click header** | Toggle sort direction |
| **Arrow keys** | Navigate rows |
