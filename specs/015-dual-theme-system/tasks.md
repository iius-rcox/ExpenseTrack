# Tasks: Dual Theme System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/015-dual-theme-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: E2E tests included per constitution requirement (test-first development)

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story for independent implementation and testing

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## User Story Summary

| Story | Priority | Description | Key Components |
|-------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| US1 | P1 | Toggle Between Light and Dark Themes | ThemeToggle, flash prevention |
| US2 | P1 | Experience Luxury Minimalist Light Theme | CSS variables (:root) |
| US3 | P1 | Experience Dark Cyber Theme | Glassmorphism, gradient text, shine animation |
| US4 | P2 | Consistent Component Styling | Update 8 components using old tokens |
| US5 | P3 | Respect System Theme Preference | ThemeProvider config (enableSystem) |

**Note**: US2, US3, and US5 share foundational infrastructure (ThemeProvider, globals.css). These are in the Foundational phase.

## Phase 7: User Story 5 - Respect System Theme Preference (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: ExpenseFlow automatically uses OS dark mode preference on first visit

**Independent Test**: Clear browser storage, set system to dark mode, load ExpenseFlow, and verify it starts in Dark Cyber theme

### Verification for User Story 5 (ThemeProvider already configured)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1: Setup
    ↓
Phase 2: Foundational (Theme Infrastructure) ← BLOCKS ALL USER STORIES
    ↓
Phase 3: US1 (Toggle) ← MVP
Phase 4: US2 (Light Theme) } Can run in parallel
Phase 5: US3 (Dark Theme)  } after Foundational
Phase 6: US4 (Components)  }
Phase 7: US5 (System Pref) }
    ↓
Phase 8: Polish & Validation
```

### User Story Dependencies

| Story | Depends On | Can Run Parallel With |
|-------|------------|----------------------|
| US1 | Phase 2 (Foundational) | US2, US3, US5 |
| US2 | Phase 2 (Foundational) | US1, US3, US5 |
| US3 | Phase 2 (Foundational) | US1, US2, US5 |
| US4 | Phase 2 + US1, US2, US3 (needs themes working) | - |
| US5 | Phase 2 (Foundational) | US1, US2, US3 |

### Within-Phase Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- T008, T009, T010 (CSS verification) can run in parallel

**Phase 5 (US3)**:
- T030, T031, T032 (applying CSS classes) can run in parallel

**Phase 6 (US4)**:
- T041-T048 (component updates) can run in parallel - different files

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 4 Component Updates

```bash
# These can all run in parallel (different files):
Task: "Update frontend/src/components/transactions/transaction-row.tsx"
Task: "Update frontend/src/components/receipts/extracted-field.tsx"
Task: "Update frontend/src/components/receipts/batch-upload-queue.tsx"
Task: "Update frontend/src/components/matching/matching-factors.tsx"
Task: "Update frontend/src/components/matching/match-review-workspace.tsx"
Task: "Update frontend/src/components/matching/batch-review-panel.tsx"
Task: "Update frontend/src/components/analytics/subscription-detector.tsx"
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story
- US1 is MVP - toggle functionality is the core feature
- US2 and US3 are verification-heavy (CSS already in Foundational)
- US4 has most parallel opportunities (8 independent component updates)
- US5 is mostly configuration verification
- Verify theme transition < 500ms per SC-001
- Use CSS variables, not hardcoded colors
- Run `npm run typecheck` after each phase
